   c) impact assessment
   d) possible solutions or mitigations
4. ENCRYPT COMMUNICATION:
   If sensitive information is involved, consider encrypting communications or using secure channels.
5. BE PATIENT:
   Understand that fixing vulnerabilities takes time. Stay available for clarifications or additional information.

   After reporting, inquire about thr fix timeline and updates. If necessary, ask for acknowledgment when the vulnerability is resolved.
